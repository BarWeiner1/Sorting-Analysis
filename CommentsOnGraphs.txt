Full Scale Graph with Extremities Removed:
    In the data possessed by the larger graph, many interesting trends could be observed.
The primary trend of interest, is that the graph contained sections of optimization in
terms of their recursion limit where larger arrays did not neccesarily result in larger run times.
As the array sizes got larger however there was more fluctuation in the run time. This can be attributed
to the nature of quicksort and the way that a pivot is selected in larger arrays. Furthermore, in various
parts of the graphs, there were large spikes that at times interfered with the data. This can be attributed to
external noise from the machine causing irregularities within the data.

Zoomed in Graph with Filtered Data:
    For my optimal recursion region I decided to zoom in on a region that showed a very flat linear section.
In this range, the run times for the arrays even as they grew in size remained fairly constant. However, even
with this very honed in range, there were still some variations and spikes within the data which can be attributed
to and accounted for by external noise. This caused minor inconsistencies in the derivatives and trends of the lines
within my selected region.
